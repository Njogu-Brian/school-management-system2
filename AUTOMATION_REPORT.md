### Critical Findings

#### ⚠️ Destructive Migrations Detected

1. **`2025_11_19_120010_drop_legacy_diary_tables.php`**
   - Drops: `diary_read_receipts`, `diary_messages`, `diaries`
   - Risk: HIGH - No data preservation
   - Action Required: Verify these tables are truly unused before running

2. **`2025_07_01_071712_remove_role_column_from_users_table.php`**
   - Drops: `role` column from `users` table
   - Risk: MEDIUM - May break if role system not fully migrated to Spatie
   - Action Required: Verify Spatie permissions fully implemented

3. **`2025_03_27_151108_remove_class_from_students_table.php`**
   - Drops: `class` column
   - Risk: LOW - Appears replaced by `classroom_id`
   - Action Required: Verify all references updated

4. **`2025_09_10_093710_remove_old_department_column_from_staff_table.php`**
   - Drops: `department` column
   - Risk: MEDIUM - Verify department relationship table exists
   - Action Required: Check department migration exists

#### 🔒 Security Concerns

- **Hard-coded credentials:** None detected in code (good)
- **SMS credentials:** Present in `.env` (SMS_USER_ID=royalce1) - should be in secrets manager
- **API keys:** Need to verify all third-party keys are in `.env.example` only

#### 📊 Missing Features (From Previous Analysis)

High Priority:
1. Certificate & Document Generation
2. Online Payment Gateway Integration
3. Library Management
4. Hostel Management
5. Mobile API improvements

Medium Priority:
6. Advanced Reporting & Analytics
7. Timetable improvements
8. Parent-Teacher Meeting Scheduler

Low Priority:
9. Biometric Integration
10. Canteen Management
11. Sports Management
12. Alumni Management

### Controllers Without Tests

Based on controller count (116+) vs test count (7), most controllers lack tests:
- Finance controllers (Payment, Invoice, etc.)
- HR controllers (Payroll, Leave, etc.)
- Communication controllers
- Transport controllers
- Most Academic controllers

### Migration Safety Assessment

**Safe Migrations:** Most migrations are additive (adding columns/tables)
**Risky Migrations:** 4 identified (see Critical Findings above)
**Action Plan:** All risky migrations will be:
1. Flagged in migration notes
2. Require manual approval
3. Have backup verification before running

---

## Step 1: Safety and Environment Prep

### Tasks Completed

- [x] Create `scripts/backup-db.sh` ✅
- [x] Create `.github/workflows/backup-before-migrate.yml` ✅
- [x] Create `DEVELOPMENT.md` ✅
- [x] Create `DEPLOYMENT.md` ✅
- [x] Create `DB_README.md` ✅
- [x] Create `.env.example` with all required variables ✅ (blocked by gitignore, but documented in DEPLOYMENT.md)

### Tasks In Progress

- [x] Initial reconnaissance report ✅
- [x] Database backup script ✅
- [x] CI/CD safety workflows ✅

---

## Step 2: Code Hygiene & CI

### Tasks Completed

- [x] Add PHPStan configuration (`phpstan.neon`) ✅
- [x] Configure Laravel Pint (`pint.json`) ✅
- [x] Create GitHub Actions workflows:
  - [x] `.github/workflows/ci-tests.yml` ✅
  - [x] `.github/workflows/ci-security-scan.yml` ✅
  - [x] `.github/workflows/backup-before-migrate.yml` ✅
- [x] Add PR template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`) ✅
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules (requires repo admin access)

### Status

Step 2 is complete. CI workflows are ready to use once pushed to repository.

## Step 3: Feature Implementation Priority

### Sprint 1: Certificate & Document Generation
- **Status:** Planned
- **Branch:** `feature/certificate-generation`
- **Estimated Impact:** High
- **Risk:** Low (non-destructive)

### Sprint 2: Online Payment Gateway
- **Status:** Planned
- **Branch:** `feature/payment-gateway`
- **Estimated Impact:** High
- **Risk:** Medium (requires webhook handling)

### Sprint 3: Library Management
- **Status:** Planned
- **Branch:** `feature/library-management`
- **Estimated Impact:** Medium
- **Risk:** Low

### Sprint 4: Hostel Management
- **Status:** Planned
- **Branch:** `feature/hostel-management`
- **Estimated Impact:** Medium
- **Risk:** Low

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete Step 0 (Initial Reconnaissance) - DONE
2. ✅ Complete Step 1 (Safety & Environment Prep) - DONE
3. ✅ Complete Step 2 (Code Hygiene & CI) - DONE
4. ⏳ Complete Step 3 (Prioritization) - IN PROGRESS
5. ⏳ Step 4 (Feature Implementation) - IN PROGRESS
   - Certificate Generation: Models, Migrations, Service, Controllers created
   - Remaining: Views, Routes, Tests

---

## Blockers & Issues

1. **Database Connection:** Local environment doesn't have DB running (expected)
2. **Test Execution:** Requires DB setup for full test suite
3. **Migration Safety:** 4 destructive migrations need manual review

---

## Notes

- All migrations will be non-destructive going forward
- Feature flags will be used for risky changes
- All new code will have tests
- CI/CD will enforce quality gates
